# Sentiment-Analysis-using-PySpark
A demonstration of pipeline building for conducting sentiment analysis

As part of the Data 603 Big Data Processing Platforms, we tested the benefits of using RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets) in processing large scale sentiment analysis. This Python code starts with demonstrating the conceptual basis of word parsing to fine-tuning and weighting the importance of parsed words, leading to a reasonably reliable model of sentiment analysis, absent complex rhetorical and nuanced usage of words.
